The function time_series_models_comparison loads a time series dataset from a CSV file, completes missing dates, fills missing values using forward fill method, and then splits the dataset into training and test sets. It then fits three time series models, namely auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Prophet, and Exponential Smoothing models, and generates forecasts for the test set using each model. Finally, it calculates the mean squared error (MSE) for each model's forecasts on the test set and returns a dictionary containing the training set, test set, forecasts, and MSEs for each model.

The ARIMA model is fitted using the auto_arima function from the pmdarima library with default parameters except for suppress_warnings=True. The Prophet model is fitted using the Prophet class from the fbprophet library with algorithm="Newton". The Exponential Smoothing model is fitted using the ExponentialSmoothing class from the statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters library with default parameters.

The forecasts from each model are then stored in a dataframe called forecasts with columns named after each model. Finally, the function creates a dataframe called errors with two columns, model and mse, where model lists the name of each model and mse lists the corresponding mean squared error for each model's forecasts on the test set. The function returns a dictionary containing four items: trainset, testset, forecasts, and errors, each containing the corresponding dataframe.
